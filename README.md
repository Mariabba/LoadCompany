# LoadCompany
This is a University project for the course of Logistics during the Master degree in Data Science and Business Informatics. There's a [report](https://github.com/Mariabba/LoadCompany/blob/main/LoadCompany-Report.pdf) with a description of the problem and the mathematical implementation. We used AMPL with the solver CPLEX.
